# vcf Contacts
Obsidian Plugin for creating contact notes from vcf file and vice-versa.

# Roadmap
- [X] adding notices on loading/generation done
- [X] create empty contact note
- [ ] merging duplicates

# Development and Maintenance
I'm no typescript developper, so I'm not planning on doing much on this plugin after once the roadmap is done. 

So if you are interested in developping/maintaining it, going through the hassle of publishing it to the community plugins, feel free to fork it.
